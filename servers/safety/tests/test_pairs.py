"""The named-substance incompatibility pairs, each safe apart and dangerous together.

Ported from Chemclaw3's `tests/test_safety_pairs.py`. That repository shipped structural hazard
screening with one generic oxidizer/reductant pair rule, and a parallel screen keyed on resolved
reagent *identity* had independently accumulated the named pairs below. Rather than keep two
screens, that knowledge moved into `rules.yaml` as SMARTS pair rules — so these tests pin it there,
because a rule that silently never fires is worse than no rule: it reports "no rule matched" for a
hazard the table claims to cover.

The azide rule is the cautionary case. Written the obvious way — the X2 form that is correct for an
*organic* azide — it never fired on a **salt**, because RDKit sanitizes the azide anion to two
one-coordinate nitrogens. It was caught only by screening a parsed molecule, which is exactly what
the rule table's own header tells a contributor to do.
