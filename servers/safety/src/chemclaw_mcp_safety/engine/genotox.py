"""Genotoxicity structural alerts — DNA-reactive motifs, never an ICH M7 classification.

Why this exists. `screen.py` holds sixteen process-safety rules and not one word about
mutagenicity. In a Chemclaw3 live run two questions that need exactly that — mutagenic-impurity
alerts, and nitrosamine risk — were answered by fabrication, one of them inventing acceptable-intake
limits and a worked purge factor. Alerts themselves are data with a long published history, so the
gap was a missing table, not a missing model.

**Why a second module and a second table rather than more rows in `rules.yaml`.** The two screens
answer different questions. `screen_hazards` answers "is this safe to run today". This one answers
"will this need a control strategy" — a regulatory-toxicology question whose controls are analytical
and whose audience is different. Conflating them is what turns a hazard screen into an ICH M7
verdict, which is precisely the fabrication above. It would also break the process-safety screen:
nitrobenzene is an ordinary reagent that table is right to pass and this one is right to flag.

**The line the code enforces.** A structural alert is a motif and is encoded here. An ICH M7 class,
a purge factor and an acceptable-intake limit are outputs of a model this system does not have (two
complementary (Q)SARs plus an Ames corpus and expert review). So no alert carries any of the three,
and `AlertResult.verdict` states on *every* result — hit or miss — that a flag is an alert for
expert assessment and not a classification. That sentence lives in the payload rather than only in a
tool docstring for the reason `ScreenResult.verdict` documents: the payload is what is in the
context window when the answer gets written.
