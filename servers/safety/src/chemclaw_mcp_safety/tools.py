"""The `safety` MCP tool surface: three cited tables, three questions, three tools.

The capabilities themselves stay in `engine/`; this module is only what the agent sees, and it is
where each tool's *description* lives, because the description is the safety-critical part. It is
the sentence that decides whether the model treats an empty result as "no rule matched" or as
"safe".

**These docstrings are the prompt, and they are carried over from Chemclaw3's own `safety` connector
word for word.** Every one of them says what its answer is *not* evidence of, and each of those
sentences exists because a live run got something wrong in a way that was measured — an invented ICH
M7 class, an invented purge factor, a recalled palladium PDE, "no hazards detected" said six times
to a chemist about to sign a risk assessment. Shortening one deletes the measurement.

**Three tools rather than one, and the split is the point.** They answer three questions a chemist
asks separately, and the previous single answer was what let one get reported as another:

- `screen_hazards` (`engine/screen.py`) — "is this safe to run today": energetic and reactive
  motifs, and dangerous combinations between a reaction's components.
- `screen_genotoxic_alerts` (`engine/genotox.py`) — "will this need a control strategy":
  DNA-reactive structural alerts, which are *not* an ICH M7 classification.
- `ich_impurity_limit` (`engine/ich.py`) — "what is the number": the transcribed ICH Q3C and Q3D
  limits, with a citation, and an honest miss when the tables do not carry the substance.

**The screens run in a worker thread, and their input is bounded.** SMARTS matching is CPU-bound C++
that holds the GIL, and this server answers every connected chat turn on one event loop — the same
reasoning `servers/chem/src/chemclaw_mcp_chem/tools.py` records. It matters more here than there:
both screens check their pair rules as a cross-product, so results grow with the *square* of a
caller-supplied list while the request stays tiny (13 KiB of SMILES measured at 251,000 flags and
2.48 s of blocked loop). `MAX_COMPONENTS` bounds the input; `asyncio.to_thread` keeps even a bounded
screen off the loop that serves everyone else. `ich_impurity_limit` is a dictionary lookup over two
small tables and needs neither — and it is the one tool here whose synchrony is a measured decision
rather than a house style.

    """Screen molecules or a reaction for known structural hazard motifs before proposing them.

    Matches each structure against a curated, literature-cited rule table (energetic and
    shock-sensitive motifs such as azides, diazo compounds, peroxides, nitrate esters and
    polynitroaromatics; reactive motifs such as hydrazines and N-halamines) and, when several
    species are given, checks for dangerous *combinations* between them (e.g. a strong oxidizer
    together with a strong reducing agent).

    Call this before recommending a synthesis, a reagent, or a set of conditions, and report
    every flag with its explanation to the chemist.

    **An empty result means no rule in the table matched — it does NOT mean the chemistry is
    safe.** Nothing here assesses toxicity, exposure, thermal stability, scale, or the process
    around the reaction. Never present this tool's output as a safety clearance or as permission
    to run an experiment; it is one input to a human's assessment, which also needs the SDS and,
    for anything energetic, a process-safety review.

    **A SMILES this cannot read in full is refused, not screened.** Pass one structure per list
    entry and nothing else in the string — no name beside it, no two structures run together, no
    units. RDKit stops at the first space, so a string like `"CCO 1-azidopropane"` would otherwise
    be screened as ethanol and come back clean. If a call is refused, fix the string and ask again;
    never report the refusal as a result.

    Args:
        smiles: One SMILES per species. Pass a single molecule to screen it alone, or every
            component of a reaction (reactants, reagents, solvents, products) to also check for
            incompatible combinations.

    Returns:
        The matched hazard flags, most serious first, each with a rule id, severity, an
        explanation of the hazard, and the literature citation it rests on, plus `screened` — the
        canonical SMILES of every structure the result actually covers, which is how a reader
        confirms the screen is about the molecules they meant.

    Use this for the regulatory-toxicology question — "will this compound or this route need a
    mutagenic-impurity control strategy?" — and for anything about nitrosamine risk. It is a
    *different* question from `screen_hazards`, which asks whether the chemistry is safe to run
    today; call whichever one the chemist actually asked about, and both when they asked about
    both.

    Matches a committed, cited table of alerts (N-nitroso, nitroaromatic, primary aromatic amine,
    aromatic azo, epoxide, aziridine, mono-functional alkyl halide, alkyl sulfonate/sulfate ester,
    alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, vinyl sulfone) and, across several components, the nitrosamine
    formation route — a nitrosatable amine meeting a nitrosating agent.

    **A flag is an alert, not a classification, and you must report it as one.** This system has no
    (Q)SAR pair, no Ames corpus and no expert rule base, so it cannot produce an ICH M7 class, an
    acceptable intake, a purge factor or a mutagenicity prediction — and neither can you. Never
    state one, not even as an illustration. An empty result is equally not a negative prediction:
    the table is ten alerts long, and absence means nothing in it matched.

    **A SMILES this cannot read in full is refused, not screened**, and the refusal names the
    component's position in the list — one structure per entry, with nothing else in the string.
    RDKit stops at the first space, so `"CCO O=[N+]([O-])c1ccccc1"` would otherwise be read as
    ethanol and answer "no alert matched" while ignoring the nitroarene.

    Args:
        smiles: One SMILES per species. Pass the whole route rather than one step — the formation
            alert can only see components given to it together, so a nitrosating agent introduced
            two steps later is invisible to a per-step call.

    Returns:
        The matched alerts, each with the motif it names, why it is an alert, and the published
        alert set it comes from — plus `screened` (the canonical SMILES of every structure the
        result covers) and a verdict that states what the result does not mean.
