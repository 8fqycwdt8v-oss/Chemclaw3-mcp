"""Approximate normal coordinates: a preconditioner for Cartesian optimization.

Why this exists even though the `xtb` binary's ANCopt is 8-11x faster than a Cartesian
optimizer. Two paths cannot use the binary, and on this server there is a third reason:

- **open-shell species**, which route to the in-process backend because the binary cannot
  apply the spin-polarization term their energy needs (`XtbSpec.for_structure`);
- **frozen atoms**, expressible as optimizer bounds but not as an xtb flag without writing
  a control file, which is precisely the input surface `xtb_cli` refuses to have;
- **an image with no `xtb` binary at all**, which is the shipped default here — see
  `servers/calc/README.md`. In that deployment the in-process optimizer is not the fallback
  path, it is the only one, so preconditioning it is not an optimization of a corner case.

So the remaining work was never "write an internal-coordinate optimizer to replace
ANCopt" — it was "make the in-process path stop being the slow one".

**What is actually wrong with Cartesian coordinates.** Nothing about the surface; the
*conditioning*. A bond stretch and a torsion differ in stiffness by two orders of
magnitude, so a step size that is sane for one is absurd for the other, and L-BFGS spends
its iterations learning that curvature from scratch. Optimizing in the eigenbasis of an
approximate Hessian, scaled by the square root of its eigenvalues, makes the surface
nearly isotropic — and because the transform is **linear**, there is no back-transformation
problem. That linearity is exactly why xtb's own optimizer uses approximate normal
coordinates rather than redundant internals.

**The model Hessian** is Lindh's pairwise form: a distance-dependent stretch constant
between every atom pair, which is cheap and needs no connectivity perception. It omits
explicit bending and torsional terms, and measuring what that costs is what made this
work at all.

On ibuprofen the model gives **37 of 99 directions essentially zero curvature**, where the
true Hessian's lower quartile is 0.089 and its median 0.40 Hartree/Angstrom^2. So the
floor is not a numerical safety net — it is *the stand-in for the missing terms*, and its
value is the claim "a direction this model cannot see is about as stiff as a typical one".
Set at 0.005 (a safety-net value) the preconditioner made optimization **10% slower**;
swept against measurement it optimizes near 1.0 and turns over by 1.5. Measured there:

| case                          | Cartesian | preconditioned |
|-------------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| naproxen                      |  44 steps |  19 steps      |
| ibuprofen                     |  71 steps |  24 steps      |
| ibuprofen, 2 atoms frozen     |  57 steps |  27 steps      |
| benzyl radical                |  10 steps |   6 steps      |

About **2x**, consistently, including the two cases this exists for. That is modest beside
ANCopt's 8-11x, and it is honest about why: with the floor this high the scale ratio is
only ~3, so the model is being used to damp the stiff directions it identifies reliably
and trusted for nothing else. A full Lindh model with angle and torsion terms would do
better, at the cost of primitive-internal machinery and a Wilson B matrix — worth it only
if these two paths ever become the common case.
