"""The `crest` binary: conformer, tautomer, protomer and non-covalent-complex sampling.

**Not installed in this image, and not installed in Chemclaw3's either.** `which crest` is empty on
both sides today, so every tool built on this module refuses identically wherever it runs — parity
is preserved by the port rather than broken by it, and nothing silently changes answer. It becomes
usable when an operator adds the binary; see `servers/calc/README.md`.

CREST removes the caveat attached to every other number here. Everything else describes **one**
conformer — whichever geometry was embedded and relaxed — and for a flexible molecule that is a
shape, not the molecule. CREST searches conformational space by metadynamics and returns the
ensemble with the energies and rotamer degeneracies that make populations computable.

Four searches, one binary:

- **conformers** — the ensemble. Measured on n-butane: two unique conformers, the anti at 59% once
  degeneracy is weighted in — the textbook answer.
- **tautomers** — enumerate and rank tautomers, which is the one question in this system where
  getting it wrong silently invalidates *every* downstream number, because a pKa, a Fukui ranking
  and a reaction energy all describe whichever tautomer was drawn.
- **protomers** / **deprotomers** — where a molecule protonates or deprotonates, ranked.
- **complex** (`--nci`) — how *two* molecules associate. The wall potential is what makes it a
  binding search rather than two molecules drifting apart.

**This module returns the ensemble and nothing else.** Boltzmann populations, conformational
entropy and the ensemble free-energy correction are pure arithmetic over these energies and
degeneracies, and they stayed in Chemclaw3 with the durable jobs that report them — the split is
physics here, orchestration and arithmetic there. What crosses the wire is what only the binary can
produce.

**Licensing, stated once because it is a real decision and not an engineering one.** CREST is
GPL-3.0. It is invoked here as a separate process over files, never linked, so the usual analysis is
that it does not affect the licence of this codebase — but shipping the binary in an image is a
distribution question that belongs to whoever owns the product, not to this module.

**Security.** Same rule as `xtb_cli` and for the same reason: argv list, `shell=False`, a fresh
temporary directory, a scrubbed environment, a timeout, and no value that could be read as an
option. The run itself uses `xtb_cli.run_isolated`: CREST forks worker subprocesses for its parallel
metadynamics steps, so a naive `subprocess.run(timeout=...)` only ever killed the one PID it tracked
and left every forked worker running as an orphan, still writing into a temporary directory that had
already been removed.
