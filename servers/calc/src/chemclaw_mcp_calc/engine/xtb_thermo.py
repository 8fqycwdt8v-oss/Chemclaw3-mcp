"""Harmonic frequencies, IR intensities and RRHO thermochemistry.

The phase that turns an *energy* into a *free energy*, which is the quantity every question about
equilibrium, selectivity and spontaneity is actually about. Three things come out of one Hessian:

- **Frequencies**, and with them the answer to "is this geometry a minimum at all?". A Gibbs energy
  computed at a saddle point is not a Gibbs energy, so `ThermochemistryResult.is_minimum` is a field
  rather than an assumption.
- **IR intensities**, essentially for free. The finite-difference loop displaces every Cartesian and
  reads the gradient; tblite hands back the dipole from the same SCF, so dipole derivatives cost one
  array we were already discarding.
- **Thermochemistry** — ZPE, enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs — by ideal-gas RRHO.

Two deliberate choices about the physics:

**Quasi-RRHO entropy (Grimme 2012).** A harmonic oscillator's entropy diverges as its frequency goes
to zero, and the lowest modes are exactly where the harmonic approximation is worst — so a 5 cm^-1
mode from a floppy molecule can contribute several kcal/mol of nonsense to G. Below `rrho_cutoff_cm`
a mode is interpolated toward a free rotor, which is what `xtb` itself does.

**The rotational symmetry number is an input, not a guess.** It shifts the entropy by exactly R
ln(sigma) — 1.4 cal/mol/K for a C2 axis, 4.9 for benzene — and deriving it needs point-group
detection this layer does not do. It defaults to 1 and is part of the key, so setting it correctly
is a recompute rather than a silent correction. The error does **not** cancel within a balanced
reaction unless both sides carry the same symmetry, and for the chemistry that matters they do not.

**Ported without the two caches.** `run_cached_thermochemistry` split the cheap arithmetic from the
expensive matrix across two store entries; here `compute_thermochemistry` computes its own Hessian
every call, which is what a stateless server does. `relax_to_minimum` survives without its store
argument, because the saddle-point escape it performs is physics rather than plumbing.

    A plain gradient optimization converges to the nearest *stationary* point, which is not always a
    minimum. The common case is mundane and universal: a force field hands over a molecule with an
    eclipsed methyl, and a Cartesian optimizer preserves that symmetry all the way down onto the
    rotational saddle. Measured on ethyl acetate — an ordinary ester, not a contrived example — the
    optimizer settles at a -42 cm^-1 mode, and the free energy computed there is not a free energy.

    The escape is standard practice and cheap: displace along the imaginary mode and re-optimize.
    Ethyl acetate needs one such step and lands 0.016 kcal/mol lower, confirming what it was — a
    shallow rotor saddle rather than a different structure.

    Bounded by `settings.xtb_minimum_refinement_attempts`, after which the result is returned as it
    stands with `is_minimum=False` intact. A structure that will not settle is reporting something
    real about itself, and looping on it is not the fix.

    **Ported without the store and without the `was_cached` third element**: every call here
    computes.
