"""The canonicalization contract with Chemclaw3, written as literal strings on both sides.

`engine/chem.py` copies a definition Chemclaw3 owns (as `servers/chem/` and `servers/safety/`
do). Neither repository imports the other, so the contract is data: inputs and the exact strings
Chemclaw3's own `chemclaw.core.chem.require_canonical_smiles` produced when run.

The table is the same in all three servers, so whichever copy moves first goes red.

Here it also derives cache keys: canonicalization precedes embedding, whose geometry hash is the
`input_hash` of every `xtb.*` key, so a divergence would address rows that do not exist. See
`tests/test_key_contract.py`.
